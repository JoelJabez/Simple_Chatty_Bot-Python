<h2>Invoking a function</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p>Even though invoking functions in Python is not about casting a spell or the like, it does sometimes work wonders. Let's start with the concept. A <strong>function</strong> is a structured fragment of code we may want to use in more than one place and more than one time. What's more, functions allow us to read both our code and that of someone else way better. Haven't they become your favorite yet?</p>
<p>Here is a simple function call:</p>
<p><code class="language-python">multiply(1, 7)</code></p>
<p>Here <code class="language-python">multiply</code> is the name of the function, and numbers in parentheses <code class="language-python">(1, 7)</code> are its <strong>arguments</strong>. What is an argument? Well, it's just a value, that will be used inside the function body. Let's go deeper into it!</p>
<h5 id="invoking-print" style="text-align: center;">Invoking print()</h5>
<p>To <strong>call</strong>, or <strong>invoke</strong>, <strong>a function</strong> in your program, simply write its name and add parentheses after it. That's all it takes! Fun fact: if you've ever typed an expression like this <code class="language-python">print("Hello, world!")</code>, you already know a little about functions. In this tiny example, however, we see the message <samp>"Hello, world!"</samp> in parentheses after the name of the <code class="language-python">print</code> function. What does it mean? This string is just an argument. And more often than not, functions do have arguments. As for the <code class="language-python">print</code> function, we may as well use it with no argument at all or even with multiple arguments:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print("Hello, world!")
print()
print("Bye,", "then!")</code></pre>
<p>And here is the output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">Hello, world!

Bye, then!</code></pre>
<p>So, the first call prints<strong> </strong>one string, and the second call of <code class="language-python">print</code> without arguments prints, an empty line, and the last call outputs our two messages as one expression. Are you surprised by these results? Then you may learn how the <code class="language-python">print</code> function works in more detail from its <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">documentation</a>. The Python documentation contains all sorts of information about the function of your interest, for example, which arguments it expects.</p>
<h5 id="built-in-functions" style="text-align: center;">Built-in functions</h5>
<p>Functions can make life easier, provided one is aware of their existence. Many algorithms are already written, so there is no need for reinvention, except perhaps for educational purposes. The Python interpreter has several functions and types <strong>built into</strong> it, so they are always available. Currently, the number of <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">built-in functions amounts to 69</a> (in the <strong>Python 3.8 </strong>version). Some of them are used to convert the <strong>object type</strong>, for example, <code class="language-python">str()</code> returns a string, <code class="language-python">int()</code> returns an integer, and <code class="language-python">float()</code> returns a floating-point number. Others deal with <strong>numbers</strong>: you can <code class="language-python">round()</code> them and <code class="language-python">sum()</code> them, find the minimum <code class="language-python">min()</code> or the maximum <code class="language-python">max()</code>. Still, others give us information about the object: its <code class="language-python">type()</code> or length <code class="language-python">len()</code>. Let's consider them in action!</p>
<p>In the following example, <code class="language-python">len()</code> counts the number of characters in the string (the same goes for any <strong>sequence</strong>, i.e. list, tuple, range, byte sequences, byte arrays).</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">number = "111"

# finding the length of an object
print(len(number))  # 3</code></pre>
<p>Then we declare the variables <code class="language-python">integer</code> and <code class="language-python">float_number</code>, convert our string to corresponding types, and write their sum into <code class="language-python">my_sum</code>. By the way, the <code class="language-python">sum()</code> function deals with iterable objects, that's why we use double parentheses. </p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># converting types
integer = int(number)  # 111
float_number = float(number)  # 111.0

# adding numbers
my_sum = sum((integer, float_number))</code></pre>
<p> The result is a floating-point number, which becomes clear after printing <code class="language-python">my_sum</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print(my_sum)  # 222.0
print(round(my_sum))  # 222</code></pre>
<p>Furthermore, you can see how to find the minimum and maximum values: in this example, the smallest number equals <samp>3</samp> and the largest number <samp>8.4</samp> (the sum of <samp>3</samp> and <samp>5.4</samp>) belongs to floats. </p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># finding the minimum and the maximum
integer = 3
float_number = 5.4
my_sum = sum((integer, float_number))

print(min(integer, float_number))  # 3
print(type(max(integer, float_number, my_sum)))  # &lt;class 'float'&gt;</code></pre>
<p> There is far more to explore, but let's sum it up.</p>
<h5 id="conclusion" style="text-align: center;">Conclusion</h5>
<p>The beauty of functions is that we can use them without clear insight into their inner structure, and how they manage to perform what we need. If you want to put a function to good use, make sure to check its documentation or try invoking the special <code class="language-python">help()</code> function with the name of the function in question wrapped in parentheses. It saves the day when the function behaves unexpectedly.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">help(len)

# Help on built-in function len in module builtins:
#
# len(obj, /)
#    Return the number of items in a container.</code></pre>
<p>Let's make a summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>functions are meant to be reusable. You can apply them multiple times with different arguments,</li>
<li>to call a function write its name followed by parentheses and place the arguments within,</li>
<li>normally, a function has documentation, which sometimes might be of huge help.</li>
</ul>
