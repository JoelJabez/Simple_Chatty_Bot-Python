<h2>Prevent cheating</h2>

<p>On Hyperskill, we sometimes need to check that the student's code doesn't use a particular method. For instance, when the task is to manually implement the factorial computation instead of using the <code class="java">factorial()</code> function from the <code class="java">math</code> module. How could we do that?</p>
<p>It is straightforward. We can override <code class="java">math.factorial()</code> to do something else â€” raise an error or print a message to the student. To do so, first, we define a function that does what we want (for example, prints a message) with the same arguments (since we want to disguise our new function as the original one). Then, outside this new function body, we need to assign it to <code class="java">math.factorial</code> this way: <code class="java">math.factorial = new_math_factorial</code> (pay attention to the absence of parentheses). Now, if the student tries to use <code class="java">math.factorial</code>, our custom function will be raised. It happens because when multiple functions with the same name exist, the later one always overrides the prior.</p>
<p>In this task, you are a content creator at Hyperskill. Implement the example with the factorial yourself. Your program should override <code class="java">math.factorial()</code> and make it <strong>print</strong> the message <code class="java">Don't cheat!</code>  instead of calculating a factorial. You <strong>don't</strong> need to call anything.</p><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 15 seconds</font><br><br>
